# ChatAppMeme
Editor for creating a Chat App for meme and exercise purposes. I was messing about with Tailwind CSS and Vue.js

## NPM Commands
Type 'npm run dev' and it will create a new stylesheet combining from Tailwind CSS and my custom tailwind.css file in the src folder. Purge option is disabled. This will include all CSS styles rule, resulting in a CSS file with a large file size. 

Type 'npm run prod' and it will create a new stylesheet combining from Tailwind CSS and my custom tailwind.css file in the src folder. Purge option is enabled, which will remove all unused CSS styles from the final CSS file. This will result in a small file size.

NPM commands can be viewed in package.json. The config files can be found in the config folder.

## Editor
All features of the chat app are editable. You can edit the title of chat group or edit any of the messages.
